### Resources for Learning

As you move forward in your pursuit of this field you will find that the base we've provided in Web 1 and Web 2 provide a solid foundation upon which you can build. In this field things can change rather quickly, so it is important to develop skills with learning on your own from online resources and keeping an eye on influential sources regularly in order to keep on the cutting edge.

Here are a few resources I have found useful over the years:

* [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/)
* [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/)
* [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
* [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/)
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

As you can imagine there are also countless blogs you can follow. Here are those from a few current big names in the field:

* [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/)
* [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/)
* [Andy Clarke](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/)
* [Val Head](https://valhead.com/)
* [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/)
* [Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/)
* [Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/)
* [Jen Simmons](http://jensimmons.com/)
* [Aarron Walter](http://aarronwalter.com/)
* [Luke Wroblewski](https://www.lukew.com/)
* [Jeffrey Zeldman](https://www.zeldman.com/)

There are also resources for experimenting and showcasing small projects such as [Codepen](https://codepen.io/). I encourage you to create an account there and use it as you explore technologies.
