### Vinh Reading Paper

For this reading paper you must read Khoi Vinh's book [*Ordering Disorder*][vinh]. (I recommend that you disable the "HTML View" so that you're reading the book in its original layout and style). See the syllabus for Reading Paper instructions. Use this 6-week schedule as a guide:

1. Read Ch. 1--2
2. Read Ch. 3
3. Read half of Ch. 4
4. Read the rest of Ch. 4 and Ch. 5
5. Write paper
