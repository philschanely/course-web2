### Reviewing Crucial Skills

In this first unit we will take time to review some of the crucial skills from the end of Web 1 as we apply them to a new project on a much more accelerated schedule.

See these lessons from Web Design I on the box model and basic layout:

* [Lesson 9: CSS Layout Tools](https://web1.learnuxd.com/lessons/09-css-layout/)
